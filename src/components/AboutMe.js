            I hold a <strong>Bachelor's degree</strong> from the Faculty of
            Engineering Sciences in Kragujevac, where I built a solid foundation
            in computer science and software engineering. Currently, I am
            pursuing a <strong>Masterâ€™s degree</strong> in Information
            Technology at the University of Kragujevac, further expanding my
            knowledge. I have a strong passion for continuous learning, whether
            through coding, following industry trends, or exploring new
            technologies.

            My main focus is frontend development, where I work with
            technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to build
            responsive and user-friendly web applications. I have experience
            optimizing performance, ensuring accessibility, and creating clean,
            maintainable code. UI/UX principles play a big role in my work, and
            I strive to create seamless digital experiences through thoughtful
            design and development.

            am highly organized, adaptable, and always eager to refine my skills
            and learn from others. Whether working independently or as part of a
            team, I am committed to delivering high-quality solutions and
            growing as a developer.
